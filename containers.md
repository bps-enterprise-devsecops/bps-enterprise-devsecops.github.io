DevOps Best Practice Document: Containerization
===============================================

Introduction
------------

Containerization has revolutionized software development and deployment by packaging applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers. This approach ensures consistency across different environments, from development to production, and significantly streamlines the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This document outlines best practices for containerizing applications, focusing on building efficient and secure images, managing them in private registries, deploying them with Helm charts to Kubernetes, and integrating robust DevSecOps practices with Aqua Security.

1\. Containerization Best Practices
-----------------------------------

Creating effective and secure container images is fundamental.

### 1.1 Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds are a powerful Docker feature that allows you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base image, and you can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, discarding everything else. This significantly reduces the final image size and attack surface.

**Benefits:**

-   **Reduced Image Size:** Only necessary runtime artifacts are included in the final image.

-   **Improved Security:** Development tools, build dependencies, and temporary files are not shipped to production.

-   **Cleaner Images:** Fewer unnecessary layers and files.

**Example Dockerfile (Node.js Multi-Stage Build):**

```
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production # Install production dependencies first for caching

COPY . .
RUN npm run build # Build your application (e.g., React, Angular, Vue)

# Stage 2: Create the final lightweight runtime image
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist # Or wherever your build output is
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json # Only if needed for runtime scripts

# If it's a web server, expose the port
EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"] # Adjust to your application's entry point

```

### 1.2 Minimal Base Images

Always start with the smallest possible base image that meets your application's needs. Alpine Linux-based images (e.g., `alpine`, `node:18-alpine`, `openjdk:17-alpine`) are generally much smaller and have fewer vulnerabilities than their full OS counterparts.

### 1.3 Optimize Layer Caching

Docker builds images layer by layer. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. If a layer changes, all subsequent layers must be rebuilt. Order your Dockerfile instructions to take advantage of caching:

-   Place frequently changing instructions (e.g., `COPY . .`) after less frequently changing ones (e.g., `COPY package.json`, `RUN npm ci`).

-   Install dependencies before copying application code.

### 1.4 Run as Non-Root User

By default, containers run as the `root` user. This is a security risk. Always create and switch to a non-root user within your Dockerfile.

**Example:**

```
# ... (previous stages) ...

FROM node:18-alpine

# Create a non-root user
RUN addgroup --system appgroup && adduser --system --ingroup appgroup appuser
USER appuser

WORKDIR /app

# ... (copy files) ...

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

```

### 1.5 Environment Variables and Secrets

-   **Environment Variables:** Use `ENV` instructions for non-sensitive configuration that changes between environments (e.g., `ENV NODE_ENV=production`).

-   **Secrets:** NEVER hardcode sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) directly into Dockerfiles or container images. Use Kubernetes Secrets, Vault, or other secret management solutions, injecting them at runtime.

### 1.6 Resource Limits

Define CPU and memory limits for your containers in your Kubernetes deployment manifests. This prevents a single container from consuming all available cluster resources and improves stability.

2\. Private Azure Container Registry (ACR)
------------------------------------------

Azure Container Registry (ACR) is a managed, private Docker registry service in Azure. It's used to store and manage your private Docker container images and related artifacts (like Helm charts).

**Best Practices for ACR:**

-   **Company Registry with Project/LOB Paths:** Use a single company-wide ACR instance and organize images by project or line of business (LOB) using repository paths (e.g., `company.azurecr.io/project/app` or `company.azurecr.io/lob/app`). This simplifies management and access control while maintaining separation between projects.

-   **Geo-Replication:** For global deployments, enable geo-replication to distribute images across multiple Azure regions, improving pull performance and disaster recovery.

-   **Vulnerability Scanning Integration:** Integrate Aqua Security container scanning (e.g., Trivy or Aqua Platform) into your CI/CD pipeline to scan images before pushing to ACR. This ensures vulnerabilities are detected and remediated early, maintaining a secure registry.

-   **Aqua Assurance Policies:** Enforce Aqua assurance policies in your deployment workflow to ensure only compliant container images are allowed to be deployed. Configure policies to block images with critical vulnerabilities or non-compliant configurations, providing automated security gates before images reach production.

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement strict RBAC to control who can push, pull, or delete images. Grant the least privilege necessary.

-   **Automated Image Pushing:** Integrate image pushing into your CI/CD pipeline after successful builds and scans.

**Example GitHub Actions step to push to ACR:**

```
# ... (after build and scan steps) ...

      - name: Azure Login
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} # Azure service principal credentials

      - name: Docker Login to ACR
        run: |
          az acr login --name <your-acr-name>

      - name: Tag and Push Docker Image to ACR
        run: |
          docker tag my-app:latest <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/my-app:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
          docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/my-app:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

```

**Note:**  `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` should be a GitHub Secret containing a JSON object for an Azure Service Principal with `AcrPush` role on your ACR.

3\. Kubernetes Deployment with Helm Charts
------------------------------------------

Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. It allows you to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

**Best Practices for Helm Charts:**

-   **Chart Structure:** Follow the standard Helm chart structure (`Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `templates/`, `charts/`).

-   **Templating:** Use Helm's templating engine effectively to parameterize your Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingresses, etc.) using `values.yaml`.

-   **`values.yaml`:**

    -   Separate environment-specific configurations into different `values.yaml` files or use `--set` flags during deployment.

    -   Keep sensitive information out of `values.yaml` (use Kubernetes Secrets).

-   **Dependencies:** Manage chart dependencies using `Chart.yaml` and `helm dependency update`.

-   **Release Management:**

    -   Use `helm upgrade --install` for idempotent deployments.

    -   Leverage Helm's rollback capabilities (`helm rollback`) for quick recovery.

    -   Integrate Helm deployment into your CD pipeline.

-   **Linter and Tests:** Use `helm lint` to check for common issues and `helm test` for chart-specific tests.

-   **Version Control:** Store your Helm charts in a separate Git repository or within the application's repository.

**Example Helm Chart Structure:**

```
my-app-chart/
├── Chart.yaml             # Information about the chart
├── values.yaml            # Default values for the chart
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment.yaml    # Kubernetes Deployment manifest
│   ├── service.yaml       # Kubernetes Service manifest
│   ├── ingress.yaml       # Kubernetes Ingress manifest (optional)
│   ├── _helpers.tpl       # Helper templates
│   └── NOTES.txt          # Instructions for users
└── charts/                # Subcharts (dependencies)

```

4\. DevSecOps with Aqua Security (Container Scans & SBOM)
---------------------------------------------------------

Integrating security throughout the container lifecycle is critical. Aqua Security provides comprehensive solutions for container security, including vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, and runtime protection.

### 4.1 Aqua Container Scans

Aqua's tools (like Trivy, or the full Aqua Platform) can scan container images for:

-   **Vulnerabilities:** CVEs in OS packages and application dependencies.

-   **Misconfigurations:** Security issues in Dockerfiles and Kubernetes configurations.

-   **Sensitive Data:** Hardcoded secrets or sensitive files.

-   **Malware:** Presence of malicious code.

**Best Practices for Aqua Scans in CI/CD:**

-   **Scan Early:** Perform scans immediately after image build.

-   **Automated Gates:** Configure your CI/CD pipeline to fail if critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are found.

-   **Policy Enforcement:** Define security policies (e.g., no critical vulnerabilities, specific base images allowed) and enforce them in the pipeline.

-   **Integration with GitHub Actions:** Use Aqua's GitHub Actions for seamless integration.

### 4.2 Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation

An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies. It's crucial for understanding your application's supply chain risks. Aqua Trivy can generate SBOMs in various formats (e.g., SPDX, CycloneDX).

**Example GitHub Actions step for Aqua Trivy Scan and SBOM Generation:**

```
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: Container Build, Scan, Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-scan-sbom:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-app:latest .

      - name: Run Aqua Trivy vulnerability scan
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: 'my-app:latest'
          format: 'table'
          exit-code: '1'
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH' # Fail on critical/high vulnerabilities

      - name: Generate SBOM with Aqua Trivy
        run: |
          trivy image --format spdx-json --output sbom.spdx.json my-app:latest
          # Upload SBOM as a workflow artifact for later use/storage
          # This SBOM can be consumed by other security tools or for compliance
      - name: Upload SBOM artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: sbom-my-app
          path: sbom.spdx.json

      # ... (Subsequent steps for pushing to ACR and deploying with Helm) ...

```

5\. Language-Specific Containerization Best Practices
-----------------------------------------------------

### 5.1 Java Applications

-   **JIB:** Consider using JIB (from Google) for building Docker images. It's a Docker-less Java container image builder that handles multi-stage builds automatically and optimizes image layers.

    -   **Maven:**  `mvn compile jib:dockerBuild`

    -   **Gradle:**  `gradle jibDockerBuild`

-   **Base Image:** Use slim OpenJDK images (e.g., `openjdk:17-jre-slim-buster` or `openjdk:17-jdk-slim-bullseye` for build, then `openjdk:17-jre-slim-bullseye` for runtime).

-   **JAR/WAR Packaging:** Ensure your application is packaged as a single executable JAR/WAR.

-   **JVM Tuning:** Tune JVM parameters (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`, garbage collector settings) within the container to optimize memory usage and performance based on allocated container resources.

-   **Entrypoint:** Use `java -jar your-app.jar` as the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD`.

### 5.2 JavaScript (Node.js) Applications

-   **Multi-Stage Builds:** Essential for Node.js to exclude `node_modules` from the final image, significantly reducing size.

-   **`.dockerignore`:** Use a comprehensive `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules` from the host, `.git`, `dist` if built in a separate stage, `npm-debug.log`).

-   **`npm ci` vs. `npm install`:** Always use `npm ci` in CI/CD and Docker builds for clean, reproducible installations based on `package-lock.json`.

-   **Production Dependencies:** Use `npm ci --only=production` in the final image stage to install only production dependencies.

-   **Environment:** Set `NODE_ENV=production` in the production image.

-   **Process Management:** For production, consider using a process manager like PM2 (though often Kubernetes handles this) or ensuring your Node.js app gracefully handles signals.
