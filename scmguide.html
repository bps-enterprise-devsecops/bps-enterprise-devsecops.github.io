        <h1>Source Code Management & Branching Policies</h1>
        <!-- BEGIN CONTENT -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Effective Source Code Management (SCM) and well-defined branching policies are foundational to successful DevOps practices. They ensure code quality, facilitate collaboration, enable continuous integration and delivery, and provide a clear history of development. This document outlines best practices for SCM, focusing on branching strategies, naming conventions, commit message guidelines, and integration with issue tracking systems like Jira.</p>
        <p>For insights into how to name your repositories, please refer to our <a href="reponaming.html">DevOps Best Practice Document: Repository Naming Conventions</a>.</p>
        <h2>1. Source Code Management Best Practices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Version Control System (VCS):</strong> Utilizing a robust VCS like Git.</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized Source of Truth:</strong> The main branch of the repository serves as the single source of truth for the latest stable code.</li>
            <li><strong>Atomic Commits:</strong> Commits should represent a single logical change, making it easier to understand history and revert if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Frequent Commits:</strong> Developers should commit small, self-contained changes frequently.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular Syncing:</strong> Developers should regularly pull changes from the remote repository to minimize merge conflicts.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> All code changes should undergo a review process before being merged into main integration branches.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Integrate automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) into the CI/CD pipeline to validate changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Branching Strategies</h2>
        <h3>2.1 GitFlow Workflow</h3>
        <p>GitFlow is a robust branching model designed for managing large projects with scheduled release cycles. It defines a strict branching model with two main branches (<code>master</code> and <code>develop</code>) and supporting branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>master (or main):</strong> Represents the production-ready code. Only stable, fully tested code is merged here. Releases are tagged from this branch.</li>
            <li><strong>develop:</strong> Integrates all new features and bug fixes for the next release. This is the primary integration branch.</li>
            <li><strong>feature/*:</strong> Used for developing new features. They branch off <code>develop</code> and merge back into <code>develop</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>release/*:</strong> Used for preparing new production releases. They branch off <code>develop</code> and merge into both <code>master</code> (or <code>main</code>) and <code>develop</code>. Only bug fixes specific to the release are allowed here.</li>
            <li><strong>hotfix/*:</strong> Used for quickly patching production bugs. They branch off <code>master</code> (or <code>main</code>) and merge back into both <code>master</code> (or <code>main</code>) and <code>develop</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
            commit id: "Initial Commit"
            branch develop
            commit id: "Develop Init"
            branch feature/add-user-profile
            commit id: "Feature A"
            commit id: "Feature B"
            checkout develop
            merge feature/add-user-profile tag: "Merge Feature"
            branch feature/implement-search
            commit id: "Feature C"
            checkout develop
            merge feature/implement-search tag: "Merge Feature 2"
            branch release/1.0.0
            commit id: "Release Prep"
            checkout main
            merge release/1.0.0 tag: "Release 1.0.0"
            checkout develop
            merge release/1.0.0 tag: "Merge Release to Develop"
            branch hotfix/fix-login
            commit id: "Hotfix A"
            checkout main
            merge hotfix/fix-login tag: "Hotfix Deployed"
            checkout develop
            merge hotfix/fix-login tag: "Merge Hotfix to Develop"
        </div>
        <h4>Pros of GitFlow</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clear Structure:</strong> Well-defined roles for each branch, making it easy to understand the project's state.</li>
            <li><strong>Supports Parallel Development:</strong> Allows multiple teams to work on features, releases, and hotfixes concurrently.</li>
            <li><strong>Ideal for Scheduled Releases:</strong> Excellent for projects with distinct release cycles and versions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cons of GitFlow</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Can be overly complex for small teams or projects with continuous delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>More Merging:</strong> Requires more frequent merging, which can lead to conflicts if not managed well.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2 GitHub Flow (Preferred)</h3>
        <p>GitHub Flow is a lightweight, continuous delivery-oriented branching model. It's simpler than GitFlow and focuses on a single main branch and short-lived feature branches.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>main (or master):</strong> Always deployable. All development flows into this branch.</li>
            <li><strong>feature/* (or any descriptive name):</strong> Created for any new work (features, bug fixes, experiments). They branch off <code>main</code> and are merged back into <code>main</code> via Pull Requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="mermaid">
        gitGraph
            commit id: "Initial Commit"
            branch feature/new-dashboard
            commit id: "Dashboard Work 1"
            commit id: "Dashboard Work 2"
            checkout main
            merge feature/new-dashboard tag: "PR #123 Merged"
            branch feature/bugfix-payment
            commit id: "Payment Fix"
            checkout main
            merge feature/bugfix-payment tag: "PR #124 Merged"
        </div>
        <h4>Pros of GitHub Flow</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Easy to understand and implement, especially for smaller teams or projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Continuous Delivery:</strong> Encourages frequent, small deployments, aligning well with CD practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Less Overhead:</strong> Fewer long-lived branches mean fewer complex merges.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cons of GitHub Flow</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less Structured for Releases:</strong> Can be challenging for projects requiring strict versioning or multiple simultaneous releases.</li>
            <li><strong>Requires Strong CI/CD:</strong> Relies heavily on automated testing and deployment to ensure <code>main</code> is always deployable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.3 When to Use Which Strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Choose GitFlow if:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your project has distinct release cycles and versions (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0).</li>
                    <li>You need to support multiple versions of the software in production simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Your team is large and requires a strict, predictable workflow.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Choose GitHub Flow if:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>You practice Continuous Delivery/Deployment and want to deploy frequently.</li>
                    <li>Your project is web-based or a SaaS application where the latest version is always active.</li>
                    <li>Your team prefers a simpler, more agile workflow.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3. Branch Naming Policies</h2>
        <p>Consistent branch naming is essential for clarity and automation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Format:</strong> All branch names MUST be in lowercase and use hyphens (<code>-</code>) as separators.</li>
            <li><strong>Prefixes:</strong> Use a clear prefix to indicate the type of work being done.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>feature/</code>: For new features or significant enhancements.<br>Example: <code>feature/user-profile-page</code>, <code>feature/api-rate-limiting</code></li>
                    <li><code>bugfix/</code>: For fixing bugs.<br>Example: <code>bugfix/login-error-fix</code>, <code>bugfix/payment-gateway-timeout</code></li>
                    <li><code>hotfix/</code>: For urgent production bug fixes (primarily for GitFlow).<br>Example: <code>hotfix/critical-security-patch</code></li>
                    <li><code>release/</code>: For preparing a new release (primarily for GitFlow).<br>Example: <code>release/1.2.0</code></li>
                    <li><code>chore/</code>: For routine maintenance tasks, build process updates, dependency upgrades, etc., that don't add features or fix bugs.<br>Example: <code>chore/update-dependencies</code>, <code>chore/refactor-logging</code></li>
                    <li><code>docs/</code>: For documentation-only changes.<br>Example: <code>docs/update-api-spec</code>, <code>docs/add-contributing-guide</code></li>
                    <li><code>refactor/</code>: For code restructuring that doesn't change external behavior.<br>Example: <code>refactor/extract-auth-module</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Jira Issue ID (Mandatory for work branches):</strong> For <code>feature/</code>, <code>bugfix/</code>, and <code>hotfix/</code> branches, include the Jira issue ID at the beginning of the descriptive part of the branch name. This directly links the branch to the related work item.<br>Example: <code>feature/JIRA-123-add-user-profile</code>, <code>bugfix/JIRA-456-fix-login-error</code></li>
            <li><strong>Descriptive Name:</strong> After the prefix and Jira ID (if applicable), provide a concise, descriptive name that summarizes the purpose of the branch. Avoid generic names.<br>Good: <code>feature/JIRA-789-implement-search-filter</code><br>Bad: <code>feature/search</code>, <code>my-branch</code>, <code>fix-bug</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Commit Message Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Clear and consistent commit messages are vital for understanding project history, debugging, and collaboration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Follow the conventional commit message format:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subject Line (Mandatory):</strong> A single line, 50 characters max, in imperative mood, describing <em>what</em> the commit does.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blank Line:</strong> A single blank line separating the subject from the body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Body (Optional but Recommended):</strong> Detailed explanation of <em>why</em> the change was made, <em>what</em> problem it solves, and <em>how</em> it was implemented. Wrap lines at 72 characters.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Jira Issue ID (Mandatory):</strong> Include the Jira issue ID in the subject line, typically at the beginning. This allows for automated linking and tracking in Jira.<br>Example: <code>JIRA-123: Add user profile page with basic info</code><br>Example: <code>JIRA-456: Fix login error when password contains special chars</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <pre><code>JIRA-789: Feat: Implement search filter on product listing

This commit introduces a new search filter functionality on the product listing page.
Users can now filter products by category and price range.

The implementation includes:
- Frontend components for filter selection.
- API endpoint for filtered product retrieval.
- Unit tests for new components and API.
</code></pre>
        <pre><code>JIRA-101: Fix: Resolve database connection leak

Identified and fixed a persistent database connection leak in the `UserService` module. The `finally` block was missing a call to close the connection, leading to resource exhaustion over time.

This fix ensures connections are properly closed after use, improving application stability.
</code></pre>
        <h2>5. Semantic Versioning (SemVer)</h2>
        <p>Semantic Versioning is a formal convention for version numbers, defined by a three-part number: <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>. This system communicates the nature of changes in each release, making it easier for consumers to understand potential impacts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MAJOR version (X.y.z):</strong> Incremented for incompatible API changes. This indicates a breaking change that might require consumers to update their code.</li>
            <li><strong>MINOR version (x.Y.z):</strong> Incremented for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner. New features are introduced without breaking existing functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>PATCH version (x.y.Z):</strong> Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes. These are typically small, non-breaking fixes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Application in SCM:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Release Tags:</strong> Every official release (e.g., from <code>master</code>/<code>main</code> or <code>release</code> branches) MUST be tagged with a semantic version number (e.g., <code>v1.0.0</code>, <code>v2.1.5</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Versioning:</strong> Consider using tools to automate version bumping based on commit messages (e.g., Conventional Commits combined with a semantic release tool).</li>
            <li><strong>Branching Strategy Alignment:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>GitFlow:</strong> <code>release/*</code> branches are specifically for preparing a new <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> version. Once merged to <code>master</code>, a tag is applied. Hotfixes also result in new patch versions.</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Flow:</strong> New <code>MAJOR</code>, <code>MINOR</code>, or <code>PATCH</code> versions are typically tagged directly from the <code>main</code> branch after a set of changes (features/fixes) are merged and deemed ready for release.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>6. Jira Issue Management Integration</h2>
        <p>Integrating SCM with Jira streamlines workflow and provides traceability from code changes back to business requirements or bug reports.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mandatory Jira Issue IDs:</strong> As outlined in branch and commit naming policies, every development-related branch and commit MUST include the relevant Jira issue ID.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Linking:</strong> Tools like Jira's Git integration (or similar plugins) can automatically link commits, branches, and pull requests to their corresponding Jira issues based on the issue ID in the name/message.</li>
            <li><strong>Workflow Transitions:</strong> Configure Jira workflows to automatically transition issue statuses (e.g., from "In Progress" to "In Review" when a PR is opened, or "Done" when a PR is merged to <code>main</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> This integration provides a complete audit trail, showing exactly which code changes relate to which user story, task, or bug.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7. Pull Request (PR) / Merge Request (MR) Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Pull Requests are central to code review and quality assurance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Small, Focused PRs:</strong> Each PR should address a single logical change or Jira issue. This makes reviews easier and faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Descriptive Titles and Descriptions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Title:</strong> Concise summary, often including the Jira ID (e.g., <code>JIRA-999: Implement user authentication</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Description:</strong> Explain the problem, the solution, any design decisions, testing performed, and potential impacts. Include screenshots or GIFs if helpful.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Automated Checks:</strong> Ensure CI/CD pipelines run automated tests, linting, and static analysis on every PR. PRs should not be mergeable if these checks fail.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Review:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mandatory Reviewers:</strong> Require at least one (preferably two) approved reviewers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Constructive Feedback:</strong> Reviewers should provide actionable, constructive feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timely Reviews:</strong> Encourage prompt reviews to avoid bottlenecks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Branch Protection Rules:</strong> Configure branch protection rules on <code>main</code>, <code>develop</code>, and <code>release</code> branches to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Require successful CI/CD checks.</li>
                    <li>Require a minimum number of approved reviews.</li>
                    <li>Disallow direct pushes to protected branches.</li>
                    <li>Require up-to-date branches before merging.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Squash and Merge (Optional):</strong> Consider squashing commits when merging feature branches to <code>main</code> (or <code>develop</code>) to maintain a clean, linear history on the main branches. Preserve individual commits on feature branches for detailed history during development.</li>
        </ul>
